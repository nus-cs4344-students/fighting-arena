Fighting Arena is a 2D multi-player fighting game.  During the play of the game, items like boxes, hammers will be falling from the sky randomly and players can pick them up as weapons to fight. Each character player controls will have its own skills and to cast the skills users need to use the keyboard (same as in KOF).
